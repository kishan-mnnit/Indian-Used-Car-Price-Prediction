# Indian-Used-Car-Price-Prediction
TThe objective of this data science project is to develop a predictive model for estimating the prices of used cars in major metropolitan cities across India. The price estimation is derived from a variety of car-related attributes such as the manufacturer, model, variant, fuel type, color, mileage, body style, transmission, year of manufacture, presence of a CNG kit, ownership history, dealership information, and quality score. By leveraging exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project aims to generate actionable insights and accurate price predictionsâ€”ultimately supporting informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers in the pre-owned car market.
